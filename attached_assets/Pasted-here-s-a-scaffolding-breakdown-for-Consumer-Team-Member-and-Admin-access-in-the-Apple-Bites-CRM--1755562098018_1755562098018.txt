1. Consumers (External Users / Clients)

🔎 Assessment Tools

Free valuation (EBITDA × NAICS multiples)

Premium valuation (adjusted multiples + value drivers scoring)

📊 Results Dashboard

High-level valuation summary

Letter grade (A–F) scoring with narrative insights

Benchmark multiples by NAICS (low / median / high)

📄 Deliverables

Downloadable valuation PDF (summary or detailed)

Suggested “next steps” based on results

📞 Follow-Up Options

Book consultation / call request

2. Team Members (Internal Ops / Analysts)

3. Admins (Leadership / Superusers)

👉 This scaffolding ensures:

Consumers only see their own valuation results + next steps.

Team Members can support and manage clients but don’t control global settings.

Admins have master-level control over the system, users, data, and billing.
